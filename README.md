The implementations of the various value iteration methods live in `/src/value_iteration/value_iteration_methods.py`

The three notebooks:
- vi.ipynb
- vi_100.ipynb
- vi_200.ipynb
contain demos of the different methods with convergence plots on 50x50, 100x100, and 200x200 size random grid mazes across varying sparsities of connections.
